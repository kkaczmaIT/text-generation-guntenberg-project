# Text Generation with Project Gutenberg

### Source
My dataset is book from Gutenberg library. Link to book: `https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653`. It book about title "Mythos of Babilonia and Assyria"

### Neural Network
After search process I found out that recurrent neural network is suitable to generate text. Recurrent neural network rely on processing on while data from previous epochs. It is available by ability to store previous inputs data.
